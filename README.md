# MERN-Stack Infrastructure

Clone this repo to provide the starter code for a comprehensive MERN-Stack project including token-based authentication.


--------
## Begin Your Project By Following These Steps:

1. Move into your code folder: `~/code`

2. You'll need two pieces of information prior to cloning the `mern-infrastructure` repo that you saved to your personal GH account:
    - The folder/repo name you want to use for your project, e.g., `tic-tac-toe`.
    - The URL to the `mern-infrastructure` repo obtained by clicking the green **[Code]** button - it should be similar to `https://github.com/<YOUR GH USERNAME>/mern-infrastructure.git`.

3. Pay attention to the last argument which is the name of the folder to clone into.  This arg is optional, and until now, there's been no need for it:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GH USERNAME>/mern-infrastructure.git tic-tac-toe
    ```

4. Move into the new project/repo folder, for example:  `cd tic-tac-toe`

5. OPTIONAL - If you don't like the name of the commit messages, etc. of the repo you just cloned, you can "start fresh" with these commands:
    - Delete the existing local repo:  `rm -rf .git`
    - Initialize a new repo:  `git init`
    - Make the first commit:  `git add -A`, then `git commit -m "Initial commit (or whatever message you want)"`

6. On your personal GitHub account, create a new **public** repo with a name matching your project folder's name, for example: `tic-tac-toe`

    > It's best NOT to initialize the repo with any of the options, e.g., "Add a README file"

7. Copy the URL shown in the **"Quick setup â€” if youâ€™ve done this kind of thing before"** block.

8. The following command will change the URL associated with the existing `origin` remote that was created by cloning:

    ```
    git remote set-url origin <PASTE THE COPIED GH URL>
    ```
    or, if you started a "fresh" repo in the OPTIONAL step 5, run
    ```
    git remote add origin <PASTE THE COPIED GH URL>
    ```

9. Push the existing commits (that were cloned) to the new repo (using the `-u` option enables using `git push` in future pushes):

    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```

10. **ðŸš¨ Slack the link to your project's GitHub repo as a reply to the message requesting such in Slack.**

11. Open the project in VS Code.

12. Install the Node modules listed as dependencies the **package.json**:  `npm i`

13. Create a **.env** file:  `touch .env`

14. Copy your Atlas MongoDB connection string from Project 2's **.env** file...

15. Add the `DATABASE_URL=<YOUR ATLAS CONNECTION STRING>` to the newly created **.env**

16. Update the database name in the connection string for your project, for example...

    From:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0-oxnsb.azure.mongodb.net/sei-cafe?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

    To:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0-oxnsb.azure.mongodb.net/tic-tac-toe?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

17. Add a `SECRET=MySecret` to the **.env**.

    > **IMPORTANT:** If you use a different SECRET than the most recent project developed using localhost:3000, be sure to delete any JWT token from local storage.  Also, note that special characters can be difficult to set on Heroku

18. The Express server won't run unless the React app's production code exists. Create the **build** folder by running: `npm run build`

19. In a terminal session, test that the Express server starts up without error:  `nodemon server`

20. In another terminal session, test that the React app starts up and displays in the browser without error.

21. Cleanup (update, delete, etc.) the existing `mern-infrastructure` code...  For example, be sure to update the `<title>` in **public/index.html**, delete extra components you don't want/need, remove the `checkToken` stuff from the users router/service/api/controller modules, etc.

22. Change the name of the project in the **package.json**.

#### Congrats, your project is all set up and ready for user stories to be implemented!
